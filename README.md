# grokExtension
An extension that works in tandem with grokLingua

## Installation
As I'm currently still developing the extension, I haven't deployed it yet to the Chrome Store.
However, you can download this folder and install it yourself locally on your browser (Chrome or Edge) to have your own working grokExtension!

Here's how you do it:

1. Download (green Code button above) and unzip this folder.
2. Navigate to your browser's Extension page (chrome://extensions or edge://extensions)
3. On the bottom left, turn on developer mode
4. On the right click "Load Unpacked" or "Load Unpacked Extension", and select the folder (unzipped) that you just downloaded.

Now you have an extension for grokLingua!

## How to Use

Highlight/select text on any webpage, then click on the extension or press Alt+G to search grokLingua. Definitions will popup for your highlighted text.
A new list will automatically be added to your account with the webpage's title and link, and the words you search. 

If a word only has a single entry, the word will automatically be added to the created list for that webpage. (Don't worry about closing the tab, you can come back to it later!)
If a word has multiple entries, click on the main word for that entry and it will be added to your list.


## Did You Know?

<strong>grokLingua lists are synced realtime</strong>! This means lists are automatically updated without having to refresh your page! 

Have a separate window open with the list of the webpage you're searching and easily click on words you just added through the extension to review their definition.
